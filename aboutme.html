        <h3>Welcome!</h3>

        <p>In the past two decades, technology has revolutionized the world of advertising, communication, and art. 
        I am adding to the revolution by majoring in Graphic Design at the most prestigous level, earning a Bachelor 
        of Fine Arts (BFA) that I can. As a student growing up in a rapidly evolving technological era, I am ambitious
        to influence upcoming generations and paving the pathway for future technological artforms.</p>

        <p> Through applying my creative versitility and perfectionism to developing concepts, graphics, layouts for product 
        illustrations, company logos and websites, I am able to communicate with customers professionally and effectively. 
        Elective classes such as Photography, Yearbook and Computer Science have well rounded my understanding of complex 
        designs virtually. I excel particularly in organization skills of design layouts, managing deadlines, and navigating through
        adversity with my partners, making sure to stay optimistic.</p>

        <p>Earning Captain in elite club soccer, earning Editor in Chief for my Yearbook class, cooperating for 4 years in extracurricular 
        student club Younglife, and earning Cum Laude every year of High School has well rounded me in terms of design, optimism, and 
        organization. Earning Captain on most soccer teams has taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and optimism through 
        adversity and prosperity. Younglife has taught me to be a sympathetic listener and to never leave someone out or left behind. 
        Academics has led me to insist on navigating the most challenging and rigorous courses in order to become confident in overseeing 
        difficulties and managing my time. </p>
