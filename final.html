            The purpose of my program is to have the player simulate playing the favorited kids game Bop It. The game is supposed to make the player connect their auditory reactions to their sensory reactions and once they hear a certain sound, they have to press a certain button. Depending on accuracy within the time limit, the player will be able to rack up a score. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The functionality represented in the program is the reaction that clicking a button after the correct sound makes the score go up, and once the time is up the player can record their score into the database and try to beat it their next time playing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The first input is a button being clicked and the output is the score going up by how many times the button was pressed. The second input is the score being recorded into the score database section and the output is the score being saved to the database and shown on the screen.
